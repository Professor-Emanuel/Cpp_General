C/C++ arrays allow you to define variables that combine several data items of the same kind, but structure is another

    You can define pointers to structures in very similar way as you define pointer to any other variable as follows

    Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of
    a structure variable, place the & operator before the structure's name as follows

    struct_pointer = &Book1;

    To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the -> operator as follows âˆ’

    struct_pointer->title;
